# Introduction to Trust-DNS

Trust-DNS is a collection of libraries and binaries that implement the DNS standard RFCs. The goal of Trust-DNS is to be a standard compliant, safe, secure, and trusted DNS implementation. The [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language, and it's ecosystem, are a significant part of offering the safety, security, and trustworthiness of the software. Trust-DNS consists of three major libraries: a client, a resolver, and a server. The client and resolver are intended to be embedded in other software libraries. The server offers binaries for operating a DNS authority. This book aims document operating DNS authorities with the Trust-DNS suite
